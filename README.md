Watchnet was born in 2019 from an idea of ​​a young university student, Danilo Santitto. It has been reviewed from the Database course examiner, a semester course of three-year degree in computer science, in Catania.

It is not officially commercialized and probably never will be, but you can still enjoy the experience and get some food for thought about React.
